# D365 Billing System Integration

This repository contains the source code and architecture for integrating Microsoft Dynamics 365 (D365) with an external Billing System. The integration facilitates seamless data exchange between D365 and the billing platform, automating invoice and customer data synchronization.

## Overview

The D365 Billing System Integration project aims to streamline billing operations by automating the flow of customer and invoice data between Dynamics 365 and the billing system. This integration reduces manual data entry, minimizes errors, and improves operational efficiency.

## Architecture

The integration is designed with a modular architecture to handle different data flows independently. The key components include:

- Customer Data Integration
- Invoice Data Integration

The repository includes high-level architecture diagrams and flowcharts to illustrate the integration process.

### Architecture Diagrams

- **High-Level Architecture:** `high_level_architecture.png`  
  Provides an overview of the system components and their interactions.

- **Customer Integration Flow:** `customer_integration_flow.png`  
  Details the process flow for synchronizing customer data.

- **Invoice Integration Flow:** `invoice_integration_flow.png`  
  Details the process flow for synchronizing invoice data.

## Source Code

The source code is located in the `src` directory and is implemented in C#. It contains the logic for connecting to D365 APIs, processing data, and communicating with the billing system.


### Prerequisites

- Microsoft Dynamics 365 environment
- Billing system API access
- .NET development environment (Visual Studio or equivalent)
- Required credentials and API keys for both systems
